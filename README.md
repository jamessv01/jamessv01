- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamessv01.
- 👀 I’m interested in, primarily, learning GitHub and using GitHub for CI/CD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cloud (AWS, Azure)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... not decided yet, but C#, iSeries (AS400), CI/CD on Azure and AWS is a good start.
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure yet! Perhaps..through GitHub?
